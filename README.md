# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares different deep learning architectures for sentiment analysis. While our models are trained on Amazon product reviews, they can be applied to analyze the sentiment of any text. We've developed three distinct neural network models:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Uses convolutional layers to extract features from text sequences
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: A simplified RNN variant that efficiently processes sequential data
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: An advanced RNN architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies

Each model was trained on a dataset of Amazon product reviews and evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models can be used for binary sentiment classification (positive/negative) on any text input.
