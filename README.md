# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares different deep learning architectures for sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. We've developed three distinct neural network models:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Uses convolutional layers to extract features from text sequences
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: A simplified RNN variant that efficiently processes sequential data
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: An advanced RNN architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies

Each model was trained on a dataset of Amazon product reviews and evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
