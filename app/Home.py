This project explores different deep learning architectures for sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. 
We've implemented and compared three distinct neural network models:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Uses convolutional layers to extract features from text sequences
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: A simplified RNN variant that efficiently processes sequential data
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: An advanced RNN architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies

Each model was trained on a dataset of Amazon product reviews and evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score. The models were implemented using TensorFlow/Keras and follow best practices 
for text classification tasks.
